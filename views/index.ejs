CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN NON-BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH
<br/><br/>
[Human-Agent Dynamics in Social Games]
<br/><br/>
You are asked to participate in a research study conducted by Dr. Iyad Rahwan and Dr. Jacob Crandall, Ph.D., from the Computing and Information Science Program at the Masdar Institute. You were selected as a possible participant in this study because you are a willing volunteer. You should read the information below, and ask questions about anything you do not understand, before deciding whether or not to participate.
<br/><br/>
- PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL
<br/><br/>
Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you are free to choose whether to be in it or not. If you choose to be in this study, you may subsequently withdraw from it at any time without penalty or consequences of any kind.  The investigator may withdraw you from this research if circumstances arise which warrant doing so.  
<br/><br/>
- PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
<br/><br/>
The purpose of this study is to investigate how different factors (e.g. social, or environmental) affect human reasoning and decision-making in different scenarios. The research will also help us design better systems that support human reasoning and decision-making both individually and in groups.
<br/><br/>

- PROCEDURES
<br/><br/>
Thank you for your interest in the experiment. If you volunteer to participate in this study, we would ask you to do the following things:
<br/><br/>
1.  You will enter a Web page on a computer screen.
<br/>2. You will receives a tutorial briefing, including the description of a single- or multi-player game. A game may consist of multiple stages.
<br/>3. You will answer a brief quiz that ensures you understand the game rules and experiment procedures.
<br/>4. You will play one or more rounds of the game. In each round, you accumulate a total score measured in terms of points.
<br/>5. After a pre-specified number of rounds, the session ends. You will be presented with a summary screen, including total score, and how the score translates to monetary reward.
<br/><br/>
Duration: Your participation in this game will take between <%= minTimeMins %> and <%= maxTimeMins %> minutes. 
<br/><br/>
- POTENTIAL RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS
<br/><br/>
Some participants may feel some discomfort if other players are not behaving as they expected. If participants do not perform well in the game, they may also feel some frustration. Note that all participants are anonymous to each other, so no one will be able to identify you. If you do experience discomforts and risks of any kind, you are free to withdraw from the study.
<br/><br/>
- POTENTIAL BENEFITS 
<br/><br/>
We hope that you enjoy your participation in the study. We anticipate that this study will also benefit society by helping us all to better understand how to design better systems to support human reasoning and decision making in an increasingly connected world. Feel free to ask the study administrator any questions you have related to the study and its purpose.
<br/><br/>
- PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATION
<br/><br/>
Your compensation consists of two elements:
<br/>1. Show-up fee: A fixed show-up fee of <%= currency %> <%= reward %> will be given to you. This fee will be paid regardless of performance in the game, provided you stay until the end of the session. If you choose to leave before the completion of the game, you will not be paid.
<br/>2. Bonus (a.k.a. Reward): This is an additional amount, up to <%= currency %> <%= maxbonus %>, awarded based on your performance (i.e. number of points you accumulate).
<br/>These will be paid out at the end of the game, provided you follow all instructions, and do so within the time allotted.
<br/><br/>
- CONFIDENTIALITY
<br/><br/>
Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can be identified with you will remain confidential and will be disclosed only with your permission or as required by law.
