          <p>Thank you for deciding to participate in the experiment.
          This HIT is part of an MIT scientific research project. Your decision to complete this HIT is voluntary. There is no way for us to identify you. The only information we will have, in addition to your responses, is the time at which you completed the survey. The results of the research may be presented at scientific meetings or published in scientific journals. 

          We are a research team at Masdar Institute and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and we seek your participation in furthering our understanding of human behavior in games.
          <p>You can make a reasonable amount of money from this game depending on the decisions you make. You are therefore advised to read the following instructions carefully in order to make informed decisions throughout the course of the game. Your participation in this game will take approximately 15 minutes.
          <p>For your participation, you will be compensated with the task's standard reward of 1USD, as well as a significant bonus that depends on your performance in the experiment. These will be paid out at the end of the game, provided you follow all instructions, and play the game till the end.
          <p>You will complete 2 stages before starting the game itself. In the first stage, you will be provided with a walkthrough of the game via screenshots of the actual game interface along with the instructions for the game. In the second stage, you will be asked 2 comprehension questions to test your understanding of the game.
          
          <p><b>After passing the comprehension test, you will be matched with a BOT who will be your associate throughout the course of the game. </b>
          
          <p>Please confirm that you are at least 18 years of age and willing to participate in good faith, using the following checkbox. If you are not willing to do so, please return the assignment.

          Â <p style='padding-left:5em'> 

            <input type='checkbox' id='confirmation'> I understand that this game requires my undivided attention for up to 15 minutes, and I am willing to commit said time and attention until the game comes to an end.

                              <p><b>Please read the instructions carefully, as you will be quizzed about them, and your earnings depend on your performance too.</b>
              <p> <b>YOUR ASSOCIATE</b>
         As a participant in this experiment, you will play a simple game with an associate who is a BOT: an intelligent algorithm. The game will only be played once, each game consisting of a number of rounds. You are matched with the same BOT across all rounds of the game.

                          <p>
                          In each round of the game, you and your associate will be individually offered a choice between two actions, A or B. You submit your choice by clicking on the option that represents that choice. In any given round, you will not be able to see the choice of your associate until after you both submit your choices.
                          <div>

                              <p>
          At the end of the round, the points obtained by both of you will be highlighted for you to see. Your points in each round will depend on your choice and the choice of your opponent. This gives rise to the four possible scenarios as shown in the table below. In each cell, the first number(in blue) represents your points and second number represents the points of your associate. Thus the scenario below occurs when you choose A and the other player chooses B.

                              <p> <b> YOUR EARNINGS</b>
          Your accumulated earnings is obtained by summing your points over all rounds of the game thus far. These points are then converted to money by multiplying each point by $0.02.
